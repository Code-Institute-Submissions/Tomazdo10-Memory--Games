* A professional looking into the Javascript,jQuery,HTML and CSS.

### User Stories

As a young aged player i would like to know:
* The abillity to easily find the controls for the game so that can be easily operate
* Audio and visual fedback when i play the game so i can know when i click something
* Visual icons so that i can recognise when i have achived something in the game. For example trophy for high score.

As a parent player, i would search for:
* Levels of difficulty for my child
* a visually positive experience in the game
* Ability to delete the stored profiles, so i can reset the game for another go or for someone else to play
* A mute button to be incliuded so it can be switched off

#### Icons

* All icons where chosen for the obvious meaning purpose so they can be understod by everyone

#### Colours

* The primary choice of text background is colour goldenrod because they have a clear aspect while contrasting each other well with the main image on the top.

* The background for the game itself was chosen the image of milky way (universe) because it is nicely laying on the back of the game an makes you more relaxed during the play. 

* Other colours in project where used from the trophy image source, using a color picker in photoshop to make sure all colours were consistent across the project.
  

#### Styling

* Buttons where given rounded corners because it keeps consistency in design and maintains the felling that all elements fit together

* Background Image of mindset with tetrominos was chosen because it gives a smarter look for the game

* Space background image was chosen because it gives positive emotional feedback at a level that apeals to a child.
 

#### Audio File 

* The Blippy Trance song was picked because it fits to the Tetris game and it gives you a relaxing moment when playing the game.

### Validation service

* [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)I've used this validator to check my validity of the HTML code.
    I found 4 errors in this code. 2 where found in part of the CSS code added in the HTML (Error: CSS: content: #ddd is not a content value, 
    Error: CSS: box-shadow: only 0 can be a unit), and the other 2 errors where In HTML code (Error: Bad value sound/Blippy Trance.mp3 for,
