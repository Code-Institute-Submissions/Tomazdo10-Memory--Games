#### Icons

* All icons where chosen for the obvious meaning purpose so they can be understod by everyone

#### Colours

* The primary choice of text background is colour goldenrod because they have a clear aspect while contrasting each other well with the main image on the top.

* The background for the game itself was chosen the image of milky way (universe) because it is nicely laying on the back of the game an makes you more relaxed during the play. 

* Other colours in project where used from the trophy image source, using a color picker in photoshop to make sure all colours were consistent across the project.
  

#### Styling

* Buttons where given rounded corners because it keeps consistency in design and maintains the felling that all elements fit together

* Background Image of mindset with tetrominos was chosen because it gives a smarter look for the game

* Space background image was chosen because it gives positive emotional feedback at a level that apeals to a child.
 

#### Audio File 

* The Blippy Trance song was picked because it fits to the Tetris game and it gives you a relaxing moment when playing the game.
